Hi.
Foreword: i hate it when I get some boiler plate task in interview applications so I'm trying to give our candidates something that will leave them with something useful for the future regardless of the outcome of the interview and you seemed like the kind of person that enjoys a challenge. That being said:

Let's talk recommendations.
You have a file:

    userId;productId
    1;12
    1;99
    1;32
    2;32
    2;77
    2;54
    2;66
    3;99
    3;42
    3;12
    3;32
    4;77
    4;66
    4;47
    5;65


Implement a reco engine with minhash that given a userId and his 
productList recommends 5 products from a similar user. 

* Extra points for sorting by similarity index. 
* Extra extra points for LSH bands.

Implementation can be minimal but needs to present some way to try it out. 

Please also provide a brief journal of what issues you encountered and how you fixed them(or at least what could be a possible solution).

Feel free to buzz me if you need clarification on anything or even if you want to discuss a certain aspect that you are having issues with.
